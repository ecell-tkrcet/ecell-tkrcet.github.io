At one or the other point of our lives, a thought of being an entrepreneur or doing a startup might have crossed all our minds. 


Many opt out real quick thinking startups as just pointless risks and a complete loss. This isn’t completely true and if you’re one of such believer do try to look at some of the famous entrepreneur's struggle on how they have overcome risks rather than worrying about their loss. 


Being an entrepreneur isn’t an easy task after all, the whole path consists of dents and cracks. It is about how you mend your way to the top.
